    "Since the LLM that will be used late has a input token limit of 512, the entire focus from now will be to contain the token size of the chunks within this limit . Too low, we'll combine them and if higher than the limit ,we'll split them . We can see from above that we have a very high variance in token counts — while many chunks lie well below 512 tokens, a significant number extend far beyond it, even reaching several thousand. This wide spread confirms the need for a systematic merging and splitting strategy to reduce variance and bring chunk sizes closer to the optimal range."
