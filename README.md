The project explores the possibility of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applied to the Constitution of India, by combining traditional information retrieval with modern language models. 
It demonstrates how raw constitutional text can be extracted, cleaned, chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector index, enabling accurate, citation-grounded answers to user queries. 
This work aims to serve as a foundation for legal and policy assistants, exam preparation tools, and broader applications in structured document retrieval.


The work is still in progress, will be uploading the whole pipeline soon ...
